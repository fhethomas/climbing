# climbing
Investigation of climbing data and possible modelling.

A webscraper tool was built to automate keyboard functions, as it was not possible to use normal webscraping tools, due to a recaptcha block.

Data was extracted from two group:
- Baseline data. These were climbing problems generated by users who were believed to be more reliable, so would grade the problems more accurately creating a 'baseline'. This is investigated in Baseline Modelling.ipynb
- General data. These are problems from the general population. Investigation work in: Analysis & Formatting.ipynb

The basic climbing board layout is as below.

Climbers create their own problems which other people can climb and set the difficulty of these climbs. The aim of this repo is to ascertain if a regression tool can be trained to identify the correct difficulty of the climb.

An example of how the images look once a problem is set:

Climbing problems are originally graded on a font scale, but these were converted to an easier to understand linear scale (Hueco scale) to simplify modelling.
